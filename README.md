## NGC2516

### 1. GAIADR2

Downloaded two fields:

1. A 3x3 deg field with the `GaiaQuery` script.
2. A 6x6 deg field with the `GaiaQuery` script, with a maximum magnitude cut at G=19 mag.

Used the `data_filter.py` script to remove not used columns from the data files.


### 2. Membership

Used the pyUPMASK algorithm in the configuration:

* `Voronoi,rkfunc,Nmembs=25,KDEP_flag=True`

The output files are stored in the `pyUPMASK_out/` folder.


### 3. Filtered files

Used the `members_filter.py` script to isolate the true members. These files are then used for the ASteCA and IMF analysis.

#### NGC2516
Generated the `NGC2516_19_filt_cut.dat` file from the 6x6 deg field processed with pyUPMASK, with the filters:

    msk = (data["probs_final"] > .99) & (data["Gmag"] < 18.5)

This results in a "clean" cluster sequence of ~1800 stars.



### 4. ASteCA

#### NGC2516
The Bayesian parallax analysis (offset +0.029) fails (the chains get stuck) but the weighted average gives a distance modulus of ~8.089 mag (2.411 mas --> 414.8 pc).

Processed with ASteCA using three fundamental parameter ranges (sequentially):

* Large
```
RZ       0.0005  0.0295

RD       7.9     8.2

The binaries mass ratio range is fixed to [0.7, 1.], following [Rubele et al. (2011)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/414/3/2204/1038836):

> The binary fraction is set to a value of 0.3 for binaries with mass ratios in the range between 0.7 and 1.0, which is consistent with the prescriptions for binaries commonly used in works devoted to recover the field SFH in the Magellanic Clouds (e.g. Holtzman et al. 1999; Harris & Zaritsky 2001; Javiel, Santiago & Kerber 2005; Noel et al. 2009). Notice that this assumption is also in agreement with the few determinations of binary fraction for stellar clusters in the LMC (Elson et al. 1998; Hu et al. 2010, both for NGC 1818, a stellar cluster younger than âˆ¼100 Myr).

This might not be the optimal choice, and needs to be properly justified.

The final distance modulus is 8.16 +/- 0.033 mag, reasonably close to the parallax estimate of 8.089 mag.



# 5. IMF

The `IMF` package was used to analyze the clusters' masses and estimate the slope of its IMF. Three fits were performed:

1. Using the single systems (P_binar < 0.5)
2. Using the binary systems (P_binar > 0.5)
3. Using the combined systems (P_binar < 1.)
